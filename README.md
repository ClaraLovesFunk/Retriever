*IF you are reviewing my application for M.Sc. Cognitive Systems: Hello! Maybe check out "Analysis" first :)

here you find: 

1. Paradigm: the thesis' underlying online experiment, created with PsychoPy3 and (a lot of) Python
2. Stimuli: stimuli sequences (called "BIG") created and checked with MATLAB
3. Analysis: the analyses of reaction times (RT) and accuracy (ACC) shown in the behavioral data using MATLAB
4. Thesis: my thesis
5. Publication: the preprint of the recently submitted publication "Asymmetric learning facilitates human inference 
of transitive relations" by Bernhard Spitzer, Simon Ciranka, Juan Linde-Domingo, Charley Wu, Ivan Padezkhi and me (also available on: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.03.437766v1)
