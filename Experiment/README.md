# Behavioral experiment Retriever TI

*if you are reviewing my application for a Master Program: Hello! Maybe first check out my Matlab Analysis :) If you want to check the self-written Python code for experiment generation without seeing the automatically created one by PsychoPy3, you need to download PsychoPy3 (https://www.psychopy.org/download.html), open "retriever_ti.psxpy" with it and check out the "code components"*

**Structure of the repository files**
*  /data is where the output files get stored when running the experiment (here deleted for data protection)
*  /instructions contains slides with the instructions for participants
* /html contains files generated by the PsychoPy Builder when exporting html
    * current version is retriever_ti.js which operates with excel files from /resources
    * /condition_files contains excel files controlling the main task for 100 participants
	* conditions_practice controls the training tasks
    * attentionChecks.xlsx controls the attention check loop - target stimulus and four answers + correct one
    * /sequences_IDs contain the stimuli for the main task and the attention checks
    * /stimuli_practice_decision has the stimuli for the practice
